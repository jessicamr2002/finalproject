<!--  Description of the history and conspiracy of The Illuminati  -->
<body>
  <br><h2>History</h2>
  <p>The Illuminati (Bavarian Illuminati) was a secret organization founded in Ingolstadt, Germany on May 1, 1776 by Adam Weishaupt and Baron Adolph von Knigge. The Illuminati consisted of Masons and former Masons. The organization opposed the Roman Catholic Church’s power over science and philosophy. The members sought to free themselves from the church and restrictions of the government. Apparently, the “secret” group did not stay secret for long. After many people gossiped about the mysterious group, the Bavarian government banned the Illuminati as well as the Freemasons.</p>
  <br><h2>Conspiracy</h2>
  <p>Although the organization has been banned for many years, many conspiracists believe the secret organization is still here. According to many theorists, the Illuminati have been conspiring to establish a “New World Order” that would have one single government to control the planet. Many other theories claim many celebrities earned their fame through The Illuminati.</p>
  <p>The list includes:</p>
  <p>Beyonce</p>
  <p>Kanye West</p>
  <p>Lady Gaga</p>
  <p>Rihanna</p>
  <p>Chris Brown</p>
  <p>Lindsay Lohan</p>
  <p>Justin Bieber</p>
  <p>George H.W. Bush</p>
  <p>George W. Bush</p>
  <p>Barack Obama</p>
  <p>And more.</p>

  <p>The Illuminati also includes various symbols like “The Eye” and “The Pyramid”, “666”, et cetera.</p>
