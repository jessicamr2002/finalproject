  <p>Speculation about Beyoncé’s 2011 pregnancy began the second she announced she was with child at the VMAs that year. There were rumors that the Carters were using a surrogate but things peaked when Bey appeared in an interview on Australian TV. You know the interview: the one that seemingly showed Bey’s stomach “folding” as she was sitting down. Her reps later told ABC that the fake baby bump rumors were “stupid, ridiculous, and false.” In 2013, Beyoncé addressed the media scrutiny in her documentary Life Is But a Dream, along with confirmation that she had a miscarriage prior to becoming pregnant with Blue Ivy. “It’s hard to go through public experiences when you’re in the public eye because it’s hard to have closure.”</p>
