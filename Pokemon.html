  <p>Pokémon Go was a huge hit as soon as it landed the app store in the summer of 2016, because apparently everyone — and I mean everyone — wants to walk around in circles catching animated creatures till their phone dies. But the fun wasn’t without drawbacks. Initially, Niantic, the developer behind the game, had almost unlimited access to Google accounts registered in the app. After that controversy got cleared up, conspiracy theorists still thought the game’s use of GPS tracking was
  questionable. Did they really need all that information on your whereabouts to give you Squirtles and Charmanders? And more importantly, were they storing it all so they could hand it over to law enforcement for something nefarious or quasi-legal? Probably not, but the possibility doesn’t seem to have deterred very many people — the game is still popular all over the world.</p>
