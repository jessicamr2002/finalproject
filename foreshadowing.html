<br>The simpsons have been able to correctly predict many things throught its 30
seasons,some of which you can see on this website, but here I will talk about the
top 10 things that have happened in the simpsons that could happen in the near future.<br>
<h2>01. Floating cars </h2>
<p>In a 2005 episode called "Future-Drama" (Season 16, Episode 15), Professor Frink
invented a machine that allowed Bart and Lisa to see into 2013. In 2013 Homer
blew his savings in an underwater house and a hover car. We are actually close
to this technology, Renault created a very futurist car called "Float".</p><br>

<h2>02. Mind control through music</h2>
<p> In a 2001 episode called "New Kids on the Blecch" (Season 12, episode 14), Bart and some ofhis friends
are in a band that was a psy-ops project by the Nevy Department that was intended
to feed children subliminal messages through their music. Some believe that we have
actually come to this already, and are several videos about it. </p><br>

<h2>03. Living in Mars</h2><br>
<p>Lisa volunteers for a future one way trip to Mars and Marge volunteers to
go with her, Lisa and Marge make it to Mars in 2051. Elon Musk's SpaceX is developing

<h2>04. President Ivanka in 2028</h2><br>
<p>In a 2016 episode called Treehouse of Horror XXVII (Season 28 episode 4) Homer
is seen wearing an Ivanka 2028 campaign button. Eventhough nothing similar to this
has yet to happen, there is nothing in our Constitution against it.</p><br>

<h2>05. The Robot take over</h2><br>
<p>In a 1994 episode called Itchy and Scratchy Land, they take a trip to a theme
park that is manned by robots, later in the episode the robots go rogue and start
to kill everyone. Many companies are already using robots in their companies
instead of hiring people , and many people actually believe this can start to happen as early
as 2048.</p><br>

<h2>06. The Big Ben Clock goes digital</h2><br>
<p>In the 1995 episode called Lisa's Wedding, we get to see into 2010, when she was in love
with a British guy and decides to take a trip with him to England, where you can
see the Big Ben clock tower, with a digital face instead of that of a clock. This
actually seems like it is very farfetched. </p><br>

<h2>07. Bigfoot is real</h2><br>
<p>In a 2002 episode Bart sees Bigfoot while getting of a bus in canada. This one is
probably the most unlikly on this list, but who knows right? Some people have gone
as far as to say they have seen him </p><br>
